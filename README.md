# Movie List Components

> Here is the [working version](https://mate-academy.github.io/vue_movies-list-components/)

Your goal in this task is to extract form implemented in [Movie List Add Form](https://github.com/mate-academy/vue_movies-list-add-form), a filter implemented in [Movie List Filter] and a movie list to separate components and use them in the `src/App.vue`.

The app should:
- show movies from `src/data/movies.json` by default
- allow to filter movies
- allow to add new movies

## Instructions

- Install Prettier Extention and use this [VSCode settings](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/tools/vscode/settings.json) to enable format on save.
- Open one more terminal and run tests with `npm test` to ensure your solution is correct.
- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://<your_account>.github.io/vue_movies-list-components/) and add it to the PR description.
